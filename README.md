This is a just a place to play and get stronger in specific languages while practicing common data structures + algorithms 


Some of the data structures like:
stack
queue

singly linked list
doubly linked list


min / max heap

hash map

other algorithms like:
all the sorting 


graph and all its representation:

adjacenscy matrix
adjacency list

graph algorithms:
BFS
DFS
Dikstra algorithm
